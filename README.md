# Python-Live-Project-Summary

## Introduction
While enrolled at The Tech Academy, I worked on a live project that was meant to simulate what a software development job would be like. The project used HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and Python within the Django framework. I, as well as several other students, were tasked with creating our own Django applications within the same project. We were given 10 stories to complete that included both front and back end development with models, views, APIs and web scraping. Our applications were assigned to be some sort of list creation web page. I decided to make a movie review app. I had used Django skills I aquired earlier through The Tech Academy's Python course, as well as new skills that I developed while working on this project. I spent a lot of time creating a thorough front end with lots of functionality and a veritile, in depth back end to compliment it. I also learned a lot about a professional developer environment working with stories, version control, and social aspects such as the daily stand ups. I enjoyed problem solving and learning new information throughout the two weeks, and I am glad that I was given this oportunity to gain more skills and experience to apply in my Computer Science career.
